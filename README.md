Raven CLI is a command-line tool designed to facilitate the code review process. It uses the power of GPT-4 and GitHub API to analyze pull requests and provide insightful reviews.

⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This is a test project. The reviews generated by this tool may not always be accurate, useful, or make sense. Always perform manual code reviews to ensure the quality of your code.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

- You'll need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed on your machine.
- An OpenAI API key for using GPT-4 and a GitHub token for accessing the GitHub API.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/phmz/raven-cli.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd raven-cli
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Build the project:

```bash
npm run build
```

# Usage

Before using Raven CLI, you need to set up the configuration with your OpenAI API key and GitHub token. You can do this with the following command:

```bash
node dist/main.js config
```

This will prompt you to enter your OpenAI API key and GitHub token.

After setting up the configuration, you can use Raven CLI in two ways:

## Local Code Review

If you want to analyze your local changes, navigate to the root directory of your local Git repository and run the following command:

```bash
node dist/main.js local
```

Raven CLI will then analyze your local changes and provide you with a review.

## Pull Request Review

If you want to analyze a pull request, run the following command:

```bash
node dist/main.js pr <repository> <pull_request_number>
```

Replace `<repository>` with the repository to review in the format `owner/repository`, and `<pull_request_number>` with the number of the pull request to review. For example:

```bash
node dist/main.js pr phmz/raven-cli 42
```

Raven CLI will then fetch the pull request details, analyze the changes, and provide you with a review.

# Development

Raven CLI is built with TypeScript. Contributions are welcome!

## Code style

This project uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting.

You can run the linter with:

```bash
npm run lint
```
