revu is a comprehensive command-line tool designed to streamline the code review process. Leveraging the advanced capabilities of GPT-4 and the GitHub API, it can analyze and provide insightful reviews on pull requests, local changes, and individual files. Additionally, revu offers an intuitive commit message generator that uses local diffs and commit history to propose appropriate commit messages. Its flexible nature aims to cover various aspects of code review, offering an efficient toolset for developers.

⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This is a test project. The reviews generated by this tool may not always be accurate, useful, or make sense. Always perform manual code reviews to ensure the quality of your code.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

- You'll need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed on your machine.
- An OpenAI API key for using GPT-4 and a GitHub token for accessing the GitHub API.

## Switching to GPT-4 Model

revu is initially set to use the GPT-3.5-turbo model. If you wish to switch to GPT-4, you can do so by modifying your `revu.json` config file:

1. Run the config command if you haven't done so already. This will generate the `revu.json` config file:
```bash
node dist/main.js config
```
2. Locate your `revu.json` config file (it's usually in the root directory of your project).
3. Find the `llm` section and then the `openai` subsection within it.
4. Change the value of `openaiModel` from `gpt-3.5-turbo` to `gpt-4`.
5. Save and close your `revu.json` config file.

Remember that using GPT-4 may result in increased API costs. Please refer to OpenAI's pricing for more information.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/phmz/revu-cli.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd revu-cli
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Build the project:

```bash
npm run build
```

# Usage

Before using revu, you need to set up the configuration with your OpenAI API key and GitHub token. You can do this with the following command:

```bash
node dist/main.js config
```

This will prompt you to enter your OpenAI API key and GitHub token.

After setting up the configuration, you can use revu in several ways:

## Local Code Review

revu can analyze local changes in two ways:

### 1. Analyzing all local changes

If you want to analyze your local changes, navigate to the root directory of your local Git repository and run the following command:

```bash
node dist/main.js local
```

revu will then analyze your local changes and provide you with a review.

### 2. Analyzing a specific file

If you want to analyze a specific file in your local directory, navigate to the root directory of your local Git repository and run the following command:

```bash
node dist/main.js local --directory <directory> --filename <filename>
```

Replace `<directory>` with the relative path of the directory to search and `<filename>` with the name of the file to review.

## Generate Commit Message

revu can propose commit messages based on local diffs and commit history. To use this feature, run the following command:

```bash
node dist/main.js commit
```

revu will prompt you to select the files you wish to commit. Once the files are selected, revu fetches the commit history and proposes a commit message. If you agree with the suggested commit message, you can proceed to commit your changes right away. If there are unselected files left, revu will ask you if you wish to continue the commit process.

## Pull Request Review

If you want to analyze a pull request, run the following command:

```bash
node dist/main.js pr <repository> <pull_request_number>
```

Replace `<repository>` with the repository to review in the format `owner/repository`, and `<pull_request_number>` with the number of the pull request to review. For example:

```bash
node dist/main.js pr phmz/revu 42
```

revu will then fetch the pull request details, analyze the changes, and provide you with a review.

# Development

revu is built with TypeScript. Contributions are welcome!

## Code style

This project uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting.

You can run the linter with:

```bash
